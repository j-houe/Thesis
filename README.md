# Option Pricing With Differential Machine Learning

The general implementations are found in the root directory with the following highlights: 

- **models.py**: PyTorch implementation of the twin network of Huge & Savine (2020)
- **approximators.py**: Classes defining the training+prediction procedure for both neural nets and polynomial regression
- **generators.py**: Generative models for LSM datasets with pathwise differentials

The 'Plots_and_tables' directory contains the code used to produce every plot (and then some) of the thesis paper with self-explanatory naming convention.
